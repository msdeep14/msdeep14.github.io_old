			A mini scale database engine.
			1) System is given a touch of Relational Database where data can be stored and retrieved in the form of tables.
			2) System reads data from and writes data to disk in blocks and there are custom blocks for each table.
			3) Meta Data of tables is stored separately which provides quick access to several information like current no. of 	records, table name, etc.
			4) Indexing using B+ Trees. The indexing reduces the overall search complexity of system.
